This is README for stream_opt.py and its related files. 

stream_opt.py performs OMP(orthogonal matchin pursuit) on large feature sets to sequence features for linear regression.

Please use rand.py as an example file:

========
A. Data Loading

1. <data_dir> contains the input files, which must be small enough to be loaded into memory individually. 
2. Each data file must be loaded with a loader class, which read the file into a pair of <X,Y>. 
3. generic_loader.py provides utility to load samples from npz files that contain "X" and "Y"; one can implement their own custom loader. 
4. stream_opt.StreamProblemData is a class that handles data loading and feature statistics computation. (XTX, XTY, and etc.)
    Your data must be loaded and processed with this. 

========
B. stream_opt.StreamOptSolverLinear and stream_opt.StreamOptSolverGLMExplicit 

1. These are linear regression solver and explicit GLM solver that 
requires StreamProblemData to function.

========
C. stream_opt.StreamOptProblem 

The class that organizes the Data and Solver and is used by the main algorithm 

========
D. stream_opt.alg_omp

Main algorithm - take a Problem object and perform OMP to sequence the feature groups of the data.
